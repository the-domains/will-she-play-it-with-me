So, this is my wife Jasmine (she's the one on the left pulling the silly face - she'll hate me for this pic), she likes games, but  she loves me.... and I love games.

This puts me on a quest then to find the games that my wife will play with me. This site is gonna track my progress on this noble endeaveor.

If she likes 'em, I get to play 'em.
